# The Linguistic Competence of Language Models
Language models clearly better understand *morphology* and *syntax* than *semantics*, *reasoning*, and *discourse*.
This distinction is evident in morphology and syntax's significantly higher Task Metric (`f1 macro` or `regression`).
Next, it makes sense to differentiate between the phenomena types (like *morphology* or *discourse*).
We find they have balanced *Discriminability* scores, which means that none of them dominates the overall ranking.
*Discriminability* measures the rank correlation of a specific dataset with the overall HolmesðŸ”Ž rankings.
Finally, the substantial *Selectivity* underlines the validity of our probing setup.
Compared to training a probe using randomized labels, our probes effectively detect linguistic patterns in the internal representation space of language models.
